# Public Transit Simulator

This is a simple public transit simulator written in C++. It allows users to create a network of stations and routes, and simulate the movement of vehicles between those stations.

## Installation

To use the simulator, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. You can download and install a C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang on your operating system.

Once you have a C++ compiler installed, you can clone this repository using Git:

`
  git clone https://github.com/simonidaa/public_transit_simulator.git
`


Then, navigate to the `public_transit_simulator` directory and compile the code using the C++ compiler:

`
  cd public_transit_simulator
  g++ -o main main.cpp
`

## Usage

To run the simulator, execute the compiled `main` file:

`./main`

The simulator will prompt you to enter the name of a file containing the network information. The file should be in the following format:
